I wanted a learning system that is fast to adapt and fast to learn. This led me down the path of looking at memory, and a lot of neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology texts. \\nEventually, after 4 years, I came up with this method to do goal-directed action prediction in lieu of rewards, and memory to override the neural network to ensure fast learning from just one observation of an environment transition.\\nThis is not the end, but only the beginning.\\nI intend to follow up on this idea, research more on memory encoding and retrieval techniques and scale it up for larger environments! Eventually, I hope to augment or even replace Reinforcement Learning with this approach. I will be doing a video on the 10-year plan for this idea shortly!\\nSpecial thanks to my supervisor Mehul Motani for giving me the leeway to pursue my own projects throughout my PhD!\\nKey Insights: \\n- Use Goal-directed action prediction, so we can do self-supervised learning on our trajectories (Given start state, goal state, predict first action)\\n- Use memory to model (state, action, next state) tuples and use it for world modelling and transition probability approximation\\n- Memory learns almost immediately, while neural network takes time to learn. Moreover, memory is used for lookahead planning. Hence, if we can use memory to find a path from start state to goal state, we will use that path rather than the neural network\\n- Multiple sampling of various trajectories using memory and selecting the best one is a good way to do self-improvement\\n- Performs very well (91.9% solve rate) compared to next-best RL algorithm Proximal Policy Optimisation (61.2% solve rate) in a 10x10 dynamic grid environment (similar performance observed in 40x40 as well)\\nCheck out the presentation and paper here: https://lnkd.in/gvDdeveW \"%numReactions% Reaction\" \"%numReactions% Reactions\" 193 \"https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/cib97epu77mrzque5gqlzjgaw\" \"https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/37hg81qnm85dsy5mbqfifg9qs\" \"https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/e7ppwfmo0if15fgie4q5r4us4\" \"https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/4v7dh2d6cuqm24mzps1pqzeqt\" \"https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/9sun4diznbhgyelaeryxy75ur\" \"https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/4iy169rwfs5rdhspekg2r5wc6\" \"https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/cjrxeu0ese8oxe32kiom8kzoh\" 23 Comments Like Comment \"Link copied to clipboard.\" \"Something went wrong while copying to clipboard.\" Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter John Chong Min Tan Pursuing Innovations in LLMs/Cognition/Memory | AgentJo/TaskGen/StrictJSON 1y Report this comment For more updates on my life research building on this, do follow me on Youtube to get the latest content: https://youtube.com/@johntanchongmin?si=ACjxAW9DDBPhNhNT Like Reply 1\\xa0Reaction John Chong Min Tan Pursuing Innovations in LLMs/Cognition/Memory | AgentJo/TaskGen/StrictJSON 1y Report this comment Also, if you would like more discussion, I actively talk about my latest ideas and more on my discord: https://discord.gg/bzp87AHJy5 Like Reply 1\\xa0Reaction John Chong Min Tan Pursuing Innovations in LLMs/Cognition/Memory | AgentJo/TaskGen/StrictJSON 1y Report this comment I am giving a talk on the 10-year plan to develop this idea.\\nDo DM me for the zoom link if you\\'re interested to attend. https://www.linkedin.com/posts/john-chong-min-tan-94652288_learning-fast-and-slow-10-years-plan-activity-7137246557824851969-znwy?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop Like Reply 3\\xa0Reactions 4\\xa0Reactions Brian Hart iOS and MacOS Engineer at Mind Machine Learning 1y Report this comment Seems relevant to what I\\'m doing.
