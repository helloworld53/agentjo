To maximize winning chances in future games, it is beneficial to continue varying my moves to cover all possibilities and avoid being predictable. Additionally, paying close attention to any emerging trends, such as repeated moves, could provide further insights into the opponent’s strategy. For instance, if the opponent repeats a move, it might be worth considering that they could do so again, and adjusting my strategy accordingly. Notably, the opponent has not played rock frequently, which might suggest a lower probability of them choosing rock in the next rounds.\u001b[0m\n"
