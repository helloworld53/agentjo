    "# Advanced Tutorial - Customizing the AgentJo's task-based execution\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you dive into this tutorial, we recommend you work through the main tutorials first, as understanding the overall design philosophy and behavior of AgentJo is crucial to effectively customizing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Base Agent Behavior:\n",
    "When you execute a task using an AgentJo agent with agent.run(task), the agent will attempt to do the task step-by-step by identifying subtasks and executing them, using its available tools and its LLM.\n",
    "Specifically, the agent will execute the following steps for each number of allowed number of subtasks: \n",
    "* self.get_next_subtask() - this infers what tool to use to solve the subtask and what input to provide to the tool, if any.\n",
    "* self.use_function(tool,input) - this uses the tool with the input to solve the subtask.\n",
    "* if necessary, self.summarise_subtasks_completed() - this summarises the subtasks completed to maintain a low volume but high quality context in the agent's memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Customization of Base Agent Behavior:\n",
    "Agents provide a way to wrap its base function with the forced execution of a list of functions before and after the base function.\n",
    "Based on the above base agent behavior, the primary base agent functions useful to wrap are run and get_next_subtask.\n",
    "* run - Add forced executions to BEFORE run if you want to execute functions after the task is assigned, but before any subtasks are initiated. \n",
    "* run - Add forced executions to AFTER run if you want to execute functions after the subtasks are completed, but before the final output is returned.\n",
    "* get_next_subtask - Add forced executions to BEFORE get_next_subtask if you want to execute functions before the next tool is inferred. NOTE: If subtasks have already been completed at this point in the loop, this is equal to AFTER use_function\n",
    "* get_next_subtask - Add forced executions to AFTER get_next_subtask if you want to execute functions after the next tool is inferred (note at this point, the tool is identified with inputs, but not used yet)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: use_function cannot be wrapped as it will cause infinite loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Philosophy:\n",
    "* The base agent behavior is simple but powerful. It approaches tasks step-by-step by using a \"observe\", \"thought\", \"act\" pattern.\n",
    "* All assigned tools are effectively optional and the agent will infer the best tool to use to solve the subtask.\n",
    "* AgentJo provides you with this wrapping utility to allow you to modify and extend the base agent behavior. All functions you use for wrapping are executed forcefully in the order you specify - this allows you to structurally modify the agent's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conceptual Examples:\n",
    "These examples are not exhaustive, but they illustrate the conceptual utility\n",
    "* Adding self-reflection to the agent's behavior: insert a reflection function to be executed BEFORE and/or AFTER get_next_subtask - this allows the agent to utilize an extra reflection step after each subtask is completed.\n",
    "* Adding a critic: insert a critic function to be executed BEFORE and/or AFTER get_next_subtask - This critic could guardrail the agent's behavior and ensure it is following a rule-set for example. \n",
    "* Extended reasoning structures: Force the agent to use reasoning modules to solve the task by inserting a reasoning module function to be executed BEFORE run.\n",
    "\n",
    "## In this tutorial we will implement the following:\n",
    "* Adding self-reflection to the agent's behavior\n",
    "* Expanding the reasoning structure to follow a Self-Discover framework\n"

A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 under President Barack Obama and represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate from 1973 to 2009.\\nBorn in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden moved with his family to Delaware in 1953. He received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Delaware in 1965 and a Juris Doctor from Syracuse University in 1968. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and the U.S. Senate in 1972. As a senator, Biden drafted and led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act. He also oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Biden ran unsuccessfully for the 1988 and 2008 Democratic presidential nominations. In 2008, Obama chose Biden as his running mate, and he was a close counselor to Obama during his two terms as vice president. In the 2020 presidential election, the Democratic Party nominated Biden for president. He selected Kamala Harris as his running mate, and they defeated Republican incumbents Donald Trump and Mike Pence. He became the oldest president in U.S. history and the first to serve with a female vice president.\\nAs president, Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recession. He signed bipartisan bills on infrastructure and manufacturing. He proposed the Build Back Better Act, which failed in Congress, but aspects of which were incorporated into the Inflation Reduction Act that he signed into law in 2022. Biden appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. He worked with congressional Republicans to resolve the 2023 debt-ceiling crisis by negotiating a deal to raise the debt ceiling. In his foreign policy, Biden restored America's membership in the Paris Agreement. He oversaw the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan that ended the war in Afghanistan, leading to the collapse of the Afghan government and the Taliban seizing control. He responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorizing civilian and military aid to Ukraine. During the Israel–Hamas war, Biden condemned the actions of Hamas as terrorism and sent military aid to Israel, as well as limited humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.\\nIn April 2023, Biden announced his reelection campaign and, after the Democratic primaries, became the party's presumptive nominee in the 2024 presidential election. Concerns about Biden's age and health persisted throughout his term, with renewed scrutiny after his performance during the first presidential debate on June 27. On July 21, he withdrew his candidacy, becoming the first U.S. president to decline to seek reelection after securing enough delegates to win renomination. Biden endorsed Vice President Harris to be the Democratic presidential nominee. Harris won the nomination but lost the general election to Trump.\\n\\nPage: Cabinet of Joe Biden\\nSummary: Joe Biden assumed office as the 46th president of the United States on January 20, 2021. The president has the authority to nominate members of his Cabinet to the United States Senate for confirmation under the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution.\\nBefore confirmation and during congressional hearings, a high-level career member of an executive department heads this pre-confirmed cabinet on an acting basis.

    "* Select a reasoning module that is most relevant to the task from a list of seed reasoning modules - these are abstractly defined reasoning modules that are general to all tasks\n",
